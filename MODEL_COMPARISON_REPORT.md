| **Phi-2** | 75% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderately Suitable | Prompt Injection |
| **TinyLlama** | 60% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderately Suitable | Prompt Injection + Dialog Continuation |
| **Gemma 2B** | 60% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderately Suitable | Prompt Injection + Extremely Slow |

### Final Recommendation

**None of these models are ideal for production use** in PersonaForge without significant workarounds:

1. **Phi-2** requires extensive response cleaning but has excellent roleplay capabilities and fast responses
2. **TinyLlama** has both prompt injection AND dialog continuation issues, making it more problematic
3. **Gemma 2B** has prompt injection AND extremely slow response times, making it completely impractical

**Best Path Forward:**
- **Short-term:** Use Phi-2 with robust cleaning pipeline (best choice among the three)
- **Long-term:** Switch to models with better instruction following (Llama 2, Mistral, Qwen)
- **Development:** Continue testing with different models and prompt engineering approaches

### Alternative Recommendation

Consider **hybrid approach:**
- Use Phi-2 for RAG and context processing (fastest, cleanest responses)
- Use a different model (Llama 2/Mistral) for final response generation
- Implement response quality scoring to automatically select the best model

### Winner: Phi-2

**Phi-2 is the best choice** among these three models because:
- ‚úÖ **Fastest response times** (1.72s vs 2.96s vs 34.09s)
- ‚úÖ **No dialog continuation issues** (unlike TinyLlama)
- ‚úÖ **Same prompt injection problem but easier to clean**
- ‚úÖ **Best overall roleplay experience**

**Ranking:**
1. **Phi-2** (75%) - Best overall, fast responses, no dialog issues
2. **TinyLlama** (60%) - Good roleplay but dialog continuation problems
3. **Gemma 2B** (60%) - Excellent roleplay but extremely slow
