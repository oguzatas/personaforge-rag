- **TinyLlama:** ~3s responses, moderate speed
- **Winner:** Phi-2 significantly faster

## Critical Issues Analysis

### Phi-2: Prompt Injection Problem
**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** Makes responses unusable without extensive cleaning  
**Root Cause:** Model training on instruction-following data without proper response formatting  
**Workaround:** Requires post-processing to remove prompt artifacts  

**Example:**
```
Input: "You are Kael Vire, a wise elven mage. Respond naturally as this character."
Output: "You are Kael Vire, a wise elven mage. Respond naturally as this character. Greetings, traveler..."
```

### TinyLlama: Prompt Injection + Dialog Continuation Problem
**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** Makes responses unusable AND breaks conversation flow  
**Root Cause:** Model training on instruction-following data + dialog continuation tendencies  
**Workaround:** Requires extensive post-processing AND prompt engineering  

**Example:**
```
Input: "User says: I'm here to investigate the rumors about corruption in the High Wards."
Output: "User says: I'm here to investigate the rumors about corruption in the High Wards. Respond as your character: Skywarden Kael Vire: That's interesting."
```

## Conclusion

### Overall Assessment

| Model | Score | Recommendation | Main Issues |
|-------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **Phi-2** | 75% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderately Suitable | Prompt Injection |
| **TinyLlama** | 60% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderately Suitable | Prompt Injection + Dialog Continuation |

### Final Recommendation

**Neither model is ideal for production use** in PersonaForge without significant workarounds:

1. **Phi-2** requires extensive response cleaning but has excellent roleplay capabilities and faster responses
2. **TinyLlama** has both prompt injection AND dialog continuation issues, making it more problematic

**Best Path Forward:**
- **Short-term:** Use Phi-2 with robust cleaning pipeline (better choice)
- **Long-term:** Switch to models with better instruction following (Llama 2, Mistral, Qwen)
- **Development:** Continue testing with different models and prompt engineering approaches

### Alternative Recommendation

Consider **hybrid approach:**
- Use Phi-2 for RAG and context processing (faster, cleaner responses)
- Use a different model (Llama 2/Mistral) for final response generation
- Implement response quality scoring to automatically select the best model

### Winner: Phi-2

**Phi-2 is the better choice** between these two models because:
- ‚úÖ Faster response times (1.72s vs 2.96s)
- ‚úÖ No dialog continuation issues
- ‚úÖ Same prompt injection problem but easier to clean
- ‚úÖ Better overall roleplay experience
