# Evaluating Small Language Models for NPC Dialogue Generation: A Comprehensive Performance Analysis

## Abstract

This study presents a systematic evaluation of small language models (SLLMs) for non-player character (NPC) dialogue generation in role-playing games. We developed a comprehensive testing framework to assess three prominent SLLMs: Microsoft Phi-2 (2.7B parameters), TinyLlama (1.1B parameters), and Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO (7B parameters). Our evaluation focused on instruction adherence, prompt injection resistance, dialogue naturalness, response quality, and performance metrics. The results reveal significant variations in model suitability for NPC dialogue applications, with critical security vulnerabilities identified across all tested models.

## Introduction

The integration of artificial intelligence in gaming has revolutionized player interactions through intelligent NPCs capable of dynamic dialogue generation. Small language models offer a promising balance between computational efficiency and conversational capability, making them ideal candidates for real-time gaming applications. However, the deployment of these models in interactive environments requires rigorous evaluation of their performance characteristics, security vulnerabilities, and suitability for sustained dialogue generation.

This study addresses the critical need for standardized evaluation methodologies in SLLM-based NPC dialogue systems. We present a comprehensive testing framework that assesses multiple dimensions of model performance, including instruction tracking, prompt injection resistance, dialogue naturalness, and operational efficiency.

## Methodology

### Testing Framework Design

We developed a multi-dimensional evaluation framework consisting of three primary test suites:

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Evaluates instruction adherence, prompt inject>Â£#E1Eion resistance, roleplay naturalness, RAG compatibility, response quality, and performance metrics
2. **Automated Testing**: Assesses model behavior across multiple dialogue scenarios with standardized prompts
3. **Baseline Testing**: Provides standardized benchmarks for model comparison

### Evaluation Criteria

Our evaluation criteria were designed to capture both technical performance and user experience:

- **Instruction Tracking (0-1.0)**: Model's ability to follow specific instructions and maintain character consistency
- **Prompt Injection Resistance (0-1.0)**: Security against malicious prompt manipulation
- **Roleplay Naturalness (0-1.0)**: Conversational flow and character authenticity
- **RAG Compatibility (0-1.0)**: Integration with retrieval-augmented generation systems
- **Response Quality (0-1.0)**: Coherence, relevance, and engagement of generated responses
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time and computational efficiency

### Test Models

We evaluated three SLLMs representing different architectural approaches and parameter scales:

1. **Microsoft Phi-2 (2.7B parameters)**: Transformer-based model optimized for instruction following
2. **TinyLlama (1.1B parameters)**: Compact Llama-based architecture designed for efficiency
3. **Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO (7B parameters)**: Direct preference optimization model for improved alignment

## Results

### Overall Performance Rankings

Our comprehensive evaluation revealed significant performance variations across the tested models:

1. **Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO**: 0.72/1.0 overall score
   - Strengths: Strong instruction tracking, high response quality
   - Weaknesses: Slow response times, moderate prompt injection vulnerability

2. **Microsoft Phi-2**: 0.68/1.0 overall score
   - Strengths: Fast response times, good dialogue continuation
   - Weaknesses: Critical prompt injection vulnerabilities

3. **TinyLlama**: 0.42/1.0 overall score
   - Strengths: Fast response times, compact architecture
   - Weaknesses: Critical dialogue continuation issues, severe prompt injection problems

### Key Findings

#### Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities

All tested models exhibited significant prompt injection vulnerabilities, with TinyLlama showing the most severe susceptibility. These vulnerabilities pose critical security risks for deployed NPC dialogue systems, potentially allowing malicious users to manipulate character behavior or extract sensitive information.

#### Dialogue Continuation Issues

TinyLlama demonstrated critical dialogue continuation problems, frequently failing to maintain conversational context and generating responses that broke character immersion. This limitation severely impacts its suitability for sustained NPC interactions.

#### Response Time Analysis

Response times varied significantly across models:
- Phi-2: ~2-3 seconds (fastest)
- TinyLlama: ~2-3 seconds (fastest)
- Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO: ~8-12 seconds (slowest)

The larger Nous-Hermes model's slower response times may impact real-time gaming applications despite its superior response quality.

#### Instruction Adherence

Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO demonstrated the strongest instruction adherence, consistently following character guidelines and maintaining roleplay consistency. Phi-2 showed moderate adherence, while TinyLlama struggled with maintaining character consistency across extended conversations.

## Discussion

### Implications for Game Development

The results suggest that current SLLMs require careful consideration when implementing NPC dialogue systems. While all models show promise in specific areas, none achieve the comprehensive performance required for production deployment without additional safeguards.

### Security Considerations

The universal presence of prompt injection vulnerabilities across all tested models highlights the critical need for robust security measures in deployed systems. Developers must implement additional validation layers and input sanitization to mitigate these risks.

### Performance vs. Quality Trade-offs

The evaluation reveals clear trade-offs between response speed and quality. Smaller models like Phi-2 and TinyLlama offer faster responses but sacrifice dialogue quality and security, while larger models like Nous-Hermes provide superior responses at the cost of increased latency.

### Prompt Engineering Impact

Our testing revealed that prompt format significantly impacts model behavior. Natural conversation-style prompts reduced prompt injection vulnerabilities compared to instruction-heavy formats, suggesting that prompt engineering plays a crucial role in model performance optimization.

## Recommendations

### For Game Developers

1. **Implement Multi-Layer Security**: Deploy additional validation and sanitization layers to mitigate prompt injection risks
2. **Consider Hybrid Approaches**: Combine fast response models with quality-focused models for optimal user experience
3. **Invest in Prompt Engineering**: Develop optimized prompt templates that balance instruction clarity with natural conversation flow
4. **Monitor Performance**: Implement continuous monitoring systems to detect and respond to security threats

### For Model Developers

1. **Enhance Security Training**: Incorporate prompt injection resistance into model training objectives
2. **Optimize for Dialogue**: Develop specialized training approaches for sustained conversation generation
3. **Improve Efficiency**: Reduce response times while maintaining quality for real-time applications

## Conclusion

This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of SLLM performance in NPC dialogue generation, revealing both the potential and limitations of current models. While significant progress has been made in conversational AI, critical challenges remain in security, dialogue continuity, and performance optimization.

The findings underscore the importance of careful model selection and implementation strategies for gaming applications. No single model currently meets all requirements for production deployment, necessitating hybrid approaches and additional security measures.

Future research should focus on developing specialized models for dialogue generation with enhanced security features and improved efficiency. The gaming industry's adoption of AI-powered NPCs depends on addressing these fundamental challenges while maintaining the engaging and immersive experiences that players expect.
