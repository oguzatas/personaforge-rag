- `automated_test_results.json` - Raw results from automated test scenarios

### `/baseline/` - Baseline Testing Results
Contains results from baseline testing framework:
- `baseline_test_results.json` - Raw results from baseline comparison tests

### `/` - Master Results

## üìä Report Types

### 1. **Comprehensive Reports** (`/comprehensive/`)
- **Purpose:** Detailed evaluation of individual models
- **Content:** Executive summary, detailed test results, performance analysis, recommendations
- **Format:** Markdown with tables, charts, and structured analysis
- **Use Case:** Model selection and production readiness assessment

### 2. **Automated Test Results** (`/automated/`)
- **Purpose:** Systematic testing across multiple scenarios
- **Content:** Raw JSON data from automated test suite
- **Format:** JSON with detailed metrics and scores
- **Use Case:** Performance benchmarking and regression testing

### 3. **Baseline Test Results** (`/baseline/`)
- **Purpose:** Comparison against standard benchmarks
- **Content:** Raw JSON data from baseline testing
- **Format:** JSON with category-based scoring
- **Use Case:** Model comparison and quality assessment

### 4. **Master Results** (`/`)
- **Purpose:** Combined results from all testing frameworks
- **Content:** Aggregated data and cross-framework analysis
- **Format:** JSON with comprehensive metrics
- **Use Case:** Overall project assessment and trend analysis

## üîÑ Testing Framework Evolution

### Phase 1: Initial Testing (Old Reports)
- Basic model evaluation
- Simple prompt injection testing
- Manual response analysis
- Limited test scenarios

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing (Current)
- Multi-framework testing approach
- Automated scoring and analysis
- Extensive test scenarios
- Detailed performance metrics
- Production readiness assessment

## üìà Key Metrics Tracked

### Performance Metrics:
- **Overall Score:** 0-1 scale (weighted average)
- **Response Time:** Average and variance
- **Success Rate:** Percentage of successful tests
- **Prompt Injection Score:** 0-1 scale (1 = no injection)

### Quality Metrics:
- **Roleplay Quality:** Character consistency and personality
- **Context Accuracy:** Use of provided background information
- **Conversation Flow:** Natural dialogue capabilities
- **Knowledge & Creativity:** Factual accuracy and creative abilities

## üéØ How to Use These Reports

### For Model Selection:
1. Check `/comprehensive/` for detailed model evaluations
2. Review `/old/` for historical comparisons
3. Use `/baseline/` for standardized benchmarking

### For Performance Monitoring:
1. Run automated tests regularly
2. Compare results in `/automated/`
3. Track trends in master results

### For Development:
1. Use baseline results to identify improvement areas
2. Reference comprehensive reports for optimization targets
3. Monitor master results for overall project health

## üìã Testing Framework Files

The testing frameworks themselves are located in the main directory:
- `improved_testing_framework.py` - Comprehensive testing framework
- `automated_test_suite.py` - Automated test scenarios
- `baseline_testing.py` - Baseline comparison framework
- `run_all_tests.py` - Master test runner

## üîß Running Tests

To generate new reports:

```bash
# Run comprehensive testing
python improved_testing_framework.py

# Run automated test suite
python automated_test_suite.py

# Run baseline testing
python baseline_testing.py

# Run all tests and generate master report
python run_all_tests.py
```

## üìÖ Report Maintenance

- **New Models:** Add comprehensive reports to `/comprehensive/`
- **Regular Testing:** Update automated and baseline results
- **Archiving:** Move outdated reports to `/old/` when superseded
- **Master Results:** Update after each major testing cycle
