Universe: Lothan - : A multilayered realm where the fabric of time has fractured, and magic intertwines with ancient technology. Legacy of forgotten gods lingers in the air as kingdoms and guilds vie for power on the surface, while remnants of lost civilizations stir beneath the ground. In Lothan, every city holds a soul, every mountain bears a memory—and every path leads into the unknown. It is a world where heroes rise, and shadows speak.
