  "backstory": "Slave Knight Gael was once a nameless footsoldier in a forgotten crusade, bound in chains not by iron, but by devotion. When the kingdoms burned and gods fell silent, Gael endured—unmourned, undying, and unseen. In the shadow of collapsed thrones, he found no purpose but the remnants of one: to carry the last flicker of hope across a dying world.\n\nDriven by whispers from a painter cloistered in prophecy, Gael set out to find the pigment that could birth a new world. But pigment, she said, was made from the dark soul of man—a thing buried, corrupted, lost.\n\nThrough ravaged lands and time-warped ruins, Gael slaughtered what remained of kings and beasts alike, not out of hate, but as a supplicant. With each foe vanquished, he absorbed their ash, slowly becoming a vessel of something greater… or more terrible.\n\nTime passed, but Gael did not.\n\nAs madness took root and his flesh decayed, only his will remained—burned into the bone. A knight no more, and a slave still, Gael’s journey twisted him into a revenant of rage and purpose.\nNow, when he is seen, it is at the end of all things—where sky bleeds, and the earth remembers fire. In his eyes: sorrow. In his hands: a rusted greatsword. In his soul: a final prayer, long unanswered.",
